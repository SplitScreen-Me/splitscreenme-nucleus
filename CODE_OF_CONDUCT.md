# Nucleus Coop Code of Conduct
We would love your help on the project, and one of the most important parts of contributing is working with the Nucleus Coop team itself! Following our Code of Conduct helps create a positive and effective environment for working on the project.

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Promoting illegal activity (such as piracy or violating software licenses)
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement by pinging @Moderators or @Administrators on the official Nucleus Coop Discord server's support channel to alert them of the issue. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Piracy and Illegal Activities
This project does **not** tolerate piracy or any other kind of illegal behavior, nor does it tolerate anything that encourages it. Consequences for violations of this policy will be based upon the enforcement guidelines listed above and the severity of the violation.

To reiterate:

* We do not make handlers that intentionally work for pirated or cracked games.
* We do not endorse nor condone emulation, cracking and pirating games, or anything else that may otherwise involve compromising the integrity of proprietary software.
* We do not endorse or condone anything that violates terms of service in online games.

Nucleus Coop is intended to be a way to play **legitimate**, software in split screen by using legitimate means. Any illegal use of the Nucleus Coop software or activity within the Nucleus Coop community is in breach of the Code of Conduct and will be dealt with accordingly.

## Additional Conduct Guidance

### Communication Reminders
* **Follow the Golden Rule** - Always be respectful, patient, and courteous! Remember, everyone working on this project is doing so with their own free time.

* **Avoid _Unsolicited_ DM's** - Please try to to initially get in touch with project developers via relevant Discord server conversations, pings in the appropriate Discord channel, issue threads on Github, etc. 

    It is not that developers don't want to collaborate - far from it! However, project developers can very easily become _bombarded_ with an overwhelming number of DM's given the size of the Nucleus Coop user base, so it's courteous to try to make first contact using a more generalized approach... And this may very well lead to DM correspondence later, if it makes sense.

* **Relentless Communication** - Let folks know what you're working on and give status updates when you can. If you get overwhelmed or have to bow out of what you're working on, no worries! Life happens! Just try to keep other developers in the loop so they know what to expect. If you are actively working on a specific issue, it is very helpful to other prospective developers if you leave a comment stating as such on the issue post. Just make sure to add a follow-up comment if that changes!

* **Avoid Duplication** - It's always a good idea to check in with the other developers before you get invested in an idea, as the current GitHub "master" branch may not have had all relevant changes pushed yet. No sense working on something that may be irrelevant!

* **Commitment** - If you plan to take on a particular issue, and have communicated this to the team, please take the commitment seriously. Please don't take on more than you can handle. This way, others with the bandwidth are free to pursue the issue without worrying about whether they might be duplicating labor. If you start working on something and have to back out for any reason, that is fine and totally understandable! Just communicate as soon as possible when your ability to commit changes! If you are working on a specific issue, the issue post itself is a great way to leave status comments that won't get lost in chat scroll.

* **Focus** - Ambitious goals are great! That said, even the simplest coding task can find a way to snowball in complexity _very_ quickly. If you are new to this project (_especially_ if you are new to working on an open source project), try to start with small, discrete issues. Broader contributions take _a lot_ more work to finish and are more likely to lead to messy code-base conflicts. When at all possible, try to narrow the scope to a single, _specific_ issue.

* **Clear Language** - Try to keep technical correspondence as clear as possible and avoid overusing colloquialisms. One of the most awesome things about GitHub is that it is easy for anyone, worldwide, to contribute to an open-source project! As such, please be mindful of potential language barriers between developers. Try to keep things clear and simple, when possible.

### Issue Submission Etiquette

* **Avoid Duplicates** - Do a quick search to see if a similar issue already exists, to avoid redundancy and cluttering up issues.

* **Stick to a Single Issue** -  Make sure that you aren’t combining multiple issues into a single ticket. If you have multiple issues (or are looking at a very high-level issue that has multiple sub-issues), make new GitHub issues for each. This makes it easier to track issue resolution and portion off tasks into more actionable chunks.

* **Note the Version and your Environment** - When creating the issue, make sure that you include details on which version of Nucleus Coop or a Handler that you are working with. This can help identify when issues first arise and identify whether they have already been resolved in newer versions. Including "environment" information (operating system, system hardware, controllers used, etc.) can help further isolate issues, in case they are only triggered by certain hardware setups.

* **Reproduce It** - When filing a bug report, if at all possible, see if you can reproduce the bug and provide detailed steps as to how you did it. This is immensely helpful in narrowing down where problematic code may be triggering.

* **Include Logs** - If at all possible, please include the text from log files when encountering a crash or other weird issue. The “New Issue” bug form itself has more details on how to do this.
